A landing page is a standalone web page that potential customers can “land” on when they click through from an email, ad, or other digital location. A landing page aims to capture information from contacts in exchange for something of value, such as a retail offer code or business-to-business (B2B) insights in the form of a white paper. Landing pages are different from other web pages in that they don’t live in the evergreen navigation of a website. They serve a specific purpose in a specific moment of an advertising campaign to a target audience.

A website’s homepage usually provides a general overview of a business. But if you have a specific, short-term goal, a landing page is a valuable online marketing channel that can help you reach that goal in the buyer's journey. Because landing pages are designed for a specific target audience, they give you the ideal opportunity to convert visitors into paying customers.

Landing pages are ideal for digital ad campaigns, but they can also be useful tools when you connect a QR code on print marketing materials to a specific page. The goal of a landing page is to convert visitors, so it’s an essential tool to have at your disposal for all types of marketing campaigns.

A landing page is a standalone web page that a person "lands" on after clicking through from an email, ad, or other digital location. Every content strategy should include the use of landing pages to convert more traffic and increase conversions.

Once a user is on your landing page, they are encouraged to take an action, such as joining your list or buying your products. If the user takes the specific desired action, then your landing page has succeeded in getting them to convert.

It’s because of what researchers call the “paradox of choice.” In simple terms, that means that the more options you give people, the harder it is for them to make a decision and act.

Imagine you're offering a free ebook. But on your landing page, you also invite your users to visit your blog and buy a product and check out your social media channels. With each ask, the chances of your users downloading your new ebook grow slimmer because you've directed their attention away from your primary objective.

On the extreme end, too many choices can overwhelm your users, causing them to stall and take no action at all. This is why it’s critical to focus on a single call to action (CTA) rather than 3 or 4.

This is why a landing page should have a clear visual hierarchy and value proposition, and should be tested for the best conversion optimization.

There are a handful of things that set homepages and landing pages apart. Homepages have:

More links. On a typical homepage, you can find at least 10 links. There's often a navigational menu at the top, links in the footer, and many in the page’s content. On a well-optimized landing page, though, you'll usually find fewer links, and sometimes only one—the link that allows your users to convert.
Broader CTAs. Your homepage introduces your business and serves as a hub from which users can navigate to other corners of your site. Because your homepage has so many jobs to do, its content is often broad and has less specific CTAs (e.g. "learn more"). Since landing pages have 1 goal, they have tailored CTAs (e.g. "download our free ebook").
A different audience and purpose. Many of the people who visit your homepage probably haven’t decided what they want yet. On the other hand, users who end up on your landing pages have already shown interest in what you offer. They’ve ventured deeper into your customer journey and are more ready to convert.
